# Hugging-Face-Implementation

We'll be implementing various NLP tasks using huggingface transformer models.

# Tasks

- Sentiment analysis (i.e. categorizing text as negative or positive);
- Text embedding (i.e. transforming a piece of text into a numerical,n-dimensional vector, representation);
- Semantic search (i.e. matching a query with the most appropriate result based on embeddings); and more!
- Clustering and dimensionality reduction.
- Text generation.

# Technologies used

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Transfomer Models
- NLP
